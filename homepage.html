                            <p> Context: Socrates is speaking to Phaedrus. There was an Egyptian god, Theuth. He invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters. The king at the time was Thamus, Theuth went to Thamus to display his inventions. Of the letters, Theuth said that this invention will make the Egyptians wiser and improve their memories, saying “μνήμης τε γὰρ καὶ σοφίας φάρμακον ηὑρέθη” or, “I have found a charm for wisdom and memory.” Thamus is not convinced. He says “τοῦτο γὰρ τῶν μαθόντων λήθην μὲν ἐν ψυχαῖς παρέξει μνήμης ἀμελετησίᾳ, ἅτε διὰ πίστιν γραφῆς ἔξωθεν ὑπ᾽ ἀλλοτρίων τύπων, οὐκ ἔνδοθεν αὐτοὺς ὑφ᾽ αὑτῶν ἀναμιμνῃσκομένους: οὔκουν μνήμης ἀλλὰ ὑπομνήσεως φάρμακον ηὗρες. σοφίας δὲ τοῖς μαθηταῖς δόξαν, οὐκ ἀλήθειαν πορίζεις: πολυήκοοι γάρ σοι γενόμενοι ἄνευ διδαχῆς πολυγνώμονες εἶναι δόξουσιν, ἀγνώμονες ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πλῆθος ὄντες, καὶ χαλεποὶ συνεῖναι, δοξόσοφοι γεγονότες ἀντὶ σοφῶν.” or, “For this invention will make forgetfulness and negligence of memory in the minds of the students/those who use it, so as through the trust in writing outside themselves by other forces, not from within themselves by their own power of remembering. You have found a charm not of memory but of reminding. You will furnish your students with the appearance of wisdom, not truth. For those having heard many things will seem to become those who have heard learned many things without teaching/instruction, when they are senseless in general and difficult to be with, seeming wise but not being wise.
                            </p>
                            <p>Takeaways: The appearance of wisdom vs. actual wisdom. Just because you have heard many things (πολυήκοοι) does not mean you know mean things (πολυγνώμονες). This text reveals similar cultural anxieties as we have today. The πολυήκοοι are difficult to be with (χαλεποὶ συνεῖναι). Additionally, this text reveals the concerns about adverse affects that inventions and technology may have on the mind. Theuth introduces letters (γράμματα) to Thamus. Theuth says that letters will increase the memory and wisdom of the Egyptians. However, Thamus says that he is false, for letters will make men more reliable on having knowledge written down rather than stored in their minds. In our modern age, we have available to us the internet and our iPhones are virtually every moment of the day. Theuth may say that there is no need to remember what decade George Washington was born in, as we can write it down. Thamus would lament the loss of traditional learning, as he claims that abandoning the practice of committing things to memory will decrease wisdom.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A look into the dissonance between 19th century Venician art and reality</p>
                            <ul class="list-inline">
                              <li>Date: December 2016</li>
                              <li>By: Giuliana</li>

                            <p>Venice has always attracted artists. The city has been represented on both the canvas and the page in a variety of ways, from Canaletto’s post-card Venice to Whistler’s
                              back-alley Venice. Appearing to continue the tradition, 19th century painter John Singer Sargent and writer Mark Twain both came to the city and produced seemingly Venetian scenes. But, upon a closer look into the composition of the works, the viewer can recognize
                              intentional aspects of imaginative constructions. Both artists staged Venetian “realities,” however these scenes are not authentic renderings of the city but rather intentionally
                              fabricated scenes driven by deeper motives. While Sargent’s purposes for doing so are a bit more elusive than Twain’s, they both create Venetian scenes with an intent that goes far
                              beyond a simple artistic representation of the city. By analyzing Sargent’s “A Street In Venice” and “An Interior In Venice” and Twain’s “Innocents Abroad,” this paper will
                              investigate how and why these artists used Venice as setting for imaginative constructions that pursue more complex purposes.</p>
                              <p>It is no secret to Sargent scholars that Venice represented more than a beautiful

holiday destination to the painter. However, it is most interesting to note that Sargent’s first

and arguably most notable biographer, Charteris, who published his biography just 2 years

after Sargent’s death, devotes only 5 weak pages to Venice. Apparently, as time went on

and scholars began to look more closely at the man behind the paintings, the true meaning of his Venice works was illuminated. Fairbrother, a more recent Sargent scholar,

appropriately asserts,  “A fuller awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of Sargent’s

temperament can clarify the seeming disconnectedness between his bravura art and a

reticent public image” (John Singer Sargent 56). The undeniable intensity of Sargent’s

Venice works can only be truly understood when the viewer considers the motivating

forces of his spirit. </p>
<p> Before looking into Sargent’s Venetian work, it is necessary to reflect on his career

history as well as what we can know of his persona. Born in 1856 in Florence to American

expatriate parents, Sargent began to cultivate his talent and interest in art at a young age by

studying at various European institutions. He quickly became renowned for portraiture

which turned out to occupy nearly 30 years of his life. As noted by nearly all of his

biographers, he soon grew bored, perhaps resentful, of his portraiture career. In his 30s and

40s, between portrait sessions with high profile individuals, Sargent often escaped on

holiday. While he vacationed to many places, Venice is where his private pursuits reveal

with great clarity the duality that existed within the artist, “To understand both the art and

the artist it is necessary to see how the different, sometimes opposing, aspects of Sargent’s

personality interacted” (Fairbrother, John Singer Sargent 21). First noted by Charteris,

Sargent did not enjoy publicity (227). This sets up a delightful irony for the modern

viewer—the man who produces artwork for the world to see is reluctant to be in the public

light himself. What then is the root of this aversion to publicity? One possible explanation

is that he was likely a closeted homosexual, struggling to reconcile his true feelings with

the social norms of the time. </p>
<p>During Sargent’s first Venetian period (1880-1882), he created an oil on wood

painting titled “A Street In Venice” (1882) that explores his preoccupation with private

moments by using elements of spatial and psychological ambiguity. Spatially, the

dramatically narrowing perspective that the dark walls creates makes this outdoors scene

feel like close-quartered interior, for there is only a slice of murky daylight visible at the

top. This mimics the spatially ambiguous nature of Venice herself, as the city lacks clear

distinction between land and water. Psychologically, the relation between the glancing man

and the woman is ambiguous. From the viewer’s perspective, there is figurative and literal

“distance” between the two figures. She seems to be aware that her presence has garnered

his attention, as she kicks up her skirts in forward motion and modestly holds her arms

against her chest. Her identity is also unclear; she could be a prostitute just as much as she

could a woman of society. The bold brushwork and dark palette make it difficult to

determine whether her garments are elaborately layered or simply tattered.</p>
<p>In regards to the two males, their bodies are hidden beneath masses of black

cloth—only the eyes of one of the men are distinguishable. The shadowy figures brood

against the wall. The one peers from atop his collar and shoots a piercing glance, creating a

cryptic, sexually charged tension. This tension is both between the woman and the man, as

it is between the viewer and the scene. Sargent paints this encounter as personal and

informal, thus making the viewer an intruding viewer. Furthermore, the three dark-hued

main figures stand in stark contrast to the light grey and white walls. This emphasizes the

personal aspect of the painting which only heightens the viewer’s sense of voyeurism.

Venice’s inherent mysterious eroticism enhances the suggestive sexuality of this encounter.

Sargent further capitalizes on Venice’s characteristic ambiguity by painting the scene with

a dark palette and voiding it of bright light.</p>

       <p> Upon first glance, “A Street In Venice” appears as a snapshot of mundane Venetian

life. However without prior knowledge, the viewer is not likely to know that Sargent

employed models for this painting and that this is a staged scene. Sargent may have created

the ambiguous and mysteriously sexual relation between the man and the woman to

represent his own anxieties about his sexuality and its place in society. Fairbrother

speculates, “if indeed Sargent balanced a public career with a repressed sexuality, his

conflicted social-sexual identity may be a key to the successful tensions within his art”

(John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist 140). Additionally, his concerns about personal

privacy are reflected in the sense of uncomfortable voyeurism that the viewer is likely to

feel when peering into this narrow corridor.</p>

<p>“A Street In Venice,” along with other works from Sargent’s first Venice period,

was not received well by critics when exhibited in Paris in 1882. However, I must think

that this was not a complete surprise to Sargent. These were painter’s paintings. I believe

that Sargent had not crafted them with a specific audience in mind, as these works were of

a more personal nature. Most Sargent scholars concur that there is a strong likelihood that

many of Sargent’s Venice works were created as an almost entirely private pursuit with no

intention of being displayed or circulated. To the 19th century art critic, “A Street In

Venice” would likely have been dismissed for its “unidealized images of workers and

bohemians” (Maine 31). Not all of Sargent’s Venice works are of this nature. However,

many of his Venetian subject paintings depict similar expressions of mysterious sexuality

and private intimacy such as “An Interior In Venice.” Painted in 1898, “An Interior In Venice” is an oil on canvas family portrait of the

Curtises who resided in the Palazzo Barbaro on the Grand Canal. When in Venice, Sargent

often stayed there as he was a distant relative. As an expression of his gratitude for their

gracious hospitality, he presented it to the matriarch, Ariana Curtis, as a gift. She rejected

the completed work on the grounds that it made her look too old and that it portrayed her

son in an indecorous manner. One can only wonder about Sargent’s intentions. Given his

relationship to the Curtises, I believe that it was not his intention to offend them, as they

housed him as a cherished guest for all these years. We can be sure that Sargent admired

his own work, for he used it as the diploma painting into the Royal Academy. What then

were the motivating forces behind the work?</p>

<p>Just as “A Street In Venice” was a private encounter, it is possible that Ariana felt

that this too was an invasion of her privacy. The family dynamics as represented in this

painting may not have been something that she wished to have broadcasted to the world.

The eye first approaches Ariana and her husband in the foreground. He, sitting next to her,

ignores her as he is engulfed in his folio. The light coming from the window spills onto the

bright white folio, immediately carrying the eye up to the unnerving, almost pained, face of

Ariana. With slightly parted lips, she holds an uncomfortable gaze with the viewer. Her

skirts overflow the painting’s border, invading our space. Similarly, we, as the intruding

viewer, are invading her space. The Curtises are simply sitting for tea, and Sargent makes

the viewer keenly aware that we are looking into something raw, honest, and slightly

awkward.</p>

<p>This scene is set in the Grand Salon of the Palazzo Barbaro, which is famous for

its ornate, extravagant beauty. However, in this painting the large back wall is darkened to the point where the detail is not visible, and only the faint outline of picture frames

remains. This is a deliberate choice by Sargent, and as it focuses the attention onto the

people, a sense of drama seems to be unfolding, further making this a scene of immense

intimacy. Whereas the element of constructed reality in “A Street In Venice” is achieved

through the use of models, “An Interior In Venice” goes about it differently. The

imaginative construction comes from the way that Sargent uses the Curtises for his own

purpose, rather than simply as a subject of a family portrait. His artistic license is

highlighted in that the Curtis’s (i.e Ariana’s) expectations for the portrait did not align with

the intentions of Sargent. Just like the glancing man in “A Street In Venice,” Ariana Curtis

gives a challenging look to the viewer, letting us now know that she does not want to be

seen.</p>

<p>Sargent segments the two pairs of relationships which highlights their stark

contrast. In the background, Ralph and his young wife interact. He seems to be flirting with

her, and she casts her eyes down at the tea she is pouring, bashfully embarrassed by his

clear affection and attention. The young couple’s youth and gaiety are juxtaposed against

the older couple’s aged disinterest in one another. Perhaps it is this generational difference

that was displeasing to Ariana, as it broadcasts the clear difference between the natures of

the two relationships. Not only are the two couples juxtaposed, but also within the two

couples there is a rift. Ariana and her husband suffer from apathy and complacency,

whereas in the younger couple there is an imbalance between Ralph’s overzealous affection

and his wife’s reservedness. There are many sets of opposition in this painting: the dark

back wall and the white figures, the flatness of that spectacularly ornate wall and the angled

form of the people, and the close quarters of the interior and the invading light of the

exterior. Henry James, whose Venetian novels explore similar themes of intimacy and

privacy, particularly enjoyed this work. Janis notes, “It is a tribute to the successful

expression of the picture’s underlying emotional tension that is was a favorite of Henry

James’s” (186). The juxtapositions of this painting emphasize such emotional tension and

psychological dynamics within the individuals, the pairs, and the family as a whole.

Just as Sargent created Venetian scenes on canvas to express deeper motivations

of his spirit, Twain performed similarly on the page. By the time of Twain’s Venetian

travels, he had already established himself as a rising humorist. Part of his success was

from his comical accounts of his travels to the Sandwich Islands. Twain capitalized on their

popularity by embarking on a lecture tour in which he told stories from his travels. Having

seen great success from both the reports and the lecture tour, Twain set out on a second

excursion. He was commissioned by a San Francisco newspaper to produce a similar series

of reports, however this time he was to venture throughout Europe with the goal of ending

up in the Holy Land. Published in 1869, “Innocents Abroad” was more often referred to by

Twain as his “Great Pleasure Excursion,” which perfectly reflects the comedic undertone of

his traditionally formatted travelogue.</p>

<p>While Sargent’s motivations for his Venetian art can be traced to the inner

machinations of his persona, Twain’s are a bit more surface level and career orientated. His

American audience had responded quite favorably to the ways in which he playfully

derided the culture and society of the Sandwich Islands. Unlike Sargent, Twain was

supremely aware of and concerned with his readership. That is because he knew that it

would be the praise and positive reception of his work by them that would continue to

catapult him to fame. For Twain, his deeper purposes for constructing Venetian “realities”

was largely in part to please his growing readership of middle class Americans.

The interesting overlap between Sargent and Twain’s work is how they both used

their imaginative constructions to create Venetian “realities” in different ways. For Twain,

he employed the power of imaginative humor to create his own elastic models of reality to

humor his audience. When reading the Venetian chapters of “Innocents Abroad,” even the

19th century reader would have been aware that Twain’s stories are absurd and unlikely

true. Why, then, does Twain fabricate Venice for the reader? Covici offers his take, “To

Mark Twain, humor—originally, perhaps, an end in itself—became a tool, a technique, for

the artist; it became a means to a variety of ends which have in common the clarification of

a reader’s vision of himself and of the nature of the society, and of the cosmos, around

him” (vii-viii). While Twain obviously was trying to gain popularity, there is substantial

social commentary in all of his work that confronts and challenges the fears and

insecurities of Americans. As I have not read Twain’s accounts of the other destinations on

the trip, I cannot comment on how Venice compares to those. However what I can analyze

is how Venice and her inherent qualities provided a setting that lent itself so suitably to

Twain’s aforementioned exploits.</p>

<p>A large part of Twain’s anti-romantic and anti-sentimentalist efforts are directed

at debunking European glory. Where else is such an endeavor more suitably executed than

in the city in which the past and present are so delicately inter-mingled? This temporal

ambiguity is a theme that draws biting mockery from Twain, “Her glory is departed, and

with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces about her she sits among her stagnant

lagoons, forlorn and beggared, forgotten of the world...A peddler of glass beads for women, and trifling toys and trinkets for school-girls and children” (217). By emphasizing this

tragic reversal, he undercuts European snobbery, thus assuring his readership that they have

nothing to be intimidated by.  </p>

<p>Twain further challenges the Old World’s traditions and beliefs by reflecting on

the falsehood of American stereotypes of Venice. Twain partakes in a different kind of

spatial play than Sargent as he emphasizes the disparity between idealized perceptions of

Venice from afar and her truly ugly nature up close. He sarcastically mocks the venerable

St. Mark’s, “Of course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory of Venice,

with its pavements worn and broken down by the passing feet of a thousand years of

plebeians and patricians-- The Cathedral of St. Mark” (225). Additionally, through the

ironical understatement of litotes, Twain calls its Byzantine architecture “unlovely,” further

emphasizing his critical reception of the city. Furthermore, in one of the most falsified

scenes of the chapter, Twain interacts with his “caterwauling” gondolier Roderigo

Gonzales Michael Angelo. He laments, “It is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice

have been blighted forever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier; this

system of destruction shall go no farther” (218). After a lengthy episode of berating the

gondolier, Twain does not even afford him a response. Twain is completely in charge of

creating Venice for his readers.</p>

             <p>  However, Twain’s account of Venice is not one-dimensional. Not only does he

undermine Venetian and European glory, he also derides the American tourist abroad, “The

gentle reader will never, never know what a consummate ass he can become, until he goes

abroad. I speak now, of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been

abroad, and therefore is not already a consummate ass” (233). Twain confronts the notion

that the American abroad has an uncontrollable desire to absorb the culture of Europe in

some pitiful attempt to gain status and pride. Similarly, he mocks the fake cultural

appropriation that Americans exhibit when abroad. He illustrates a hotel registry in which

Americans such as Monsieur Gor-r-dong have signed their names and apparently

“forgotten” how to write it in English (223). In this instance, I think he is commenting on

how Americans have an inherent inferiority complex to Europeans who are able to claim a

more illustrious, cultured past. Twain does not tip toe around the fears and insecurities of

Americans. Would his readership have found this self-deprecating material comical or

slightly offensive? I imagine the former, for through the use of humor balanced with

European mockery, these insecurities are not as unnerving for his audience to encounter.

Through this imaginative humor, Twain creates a Venice that both entertains his audience

while also encouraging them to question the nature of their society.

Throughout the semester we have studied how artists use Venice as a setting for

their work. However, we have seldom explored past the surface of these artists’ lives. “A

Street In Venice,” “An Interior in Venice,” and “Innocents Abroad” are three examples of

how deeper analysis the personae of the artists can illuminate intentions and meaning that

would’ve otherwise been lost. Furthermore, the answer to “why Venice?” is greatly

enhanced when considering the motivating forces of Sargent’s spirit and the audience of

Twain. By thinking critically about just how real their Venetian “realities” are, the complex

purposes behind the art and the artist are revealed.</p>

                            <p>During the reign of Emperor Hadrian from 117-138 CE, the Roman Empire may

have seemed like a singular entity on the surface. But looking past that façade, one can

see a variety of unique and thriving peoples trying to negotiate with the larger power.

Specifically, this reign marked a clash between the Jews and the Romans in Judaea.

Akiba, the leading Rabbi at the time, championed the Jewish cause as he focused on

ensuring a thriving study of Torah. Similarly, Hadrian attempted to unite the Roman

Empire without the deafening blow of uniformity. Traditionally, scholarship has focused

on each man separately. Yet they were contemporaries, who did not simply exist on the

margins of each other’s distant horizons, but rather, were prominent forces within each

other’s worlds. One can only wonder: if they had met, how might they have presented

their convictions to each other? In this paper, I propose to examine how their views

shaped the realities in which they inhabited. In so doing, two different worlds are

revealed: the Roman and the Jewish.</p><p> At the beginning of Akiba’s scholarship in 69, the cultural environment of Judaea

was in flux between two bipolar entities: the patricians and the plebeians. While there

were many inequalities between these groups, the one that had the most influence in

regards to Akiba’s life was the disparity of classes’ influence upon the study of Law (94).

The establishment of the academy at Yabneh addressed this disparity. Granted by Roman

Emperor Vespasian in 68, Yabneh’s creation by Johanan ben Zakkai represented the

changing tide of Judaism, often being described as “true Sanhedrin of all Israel” (69). The

conditions were prime for Akiba to exercise the primary function of his life, rabbinic

scholarship, in a place teeming with a selfless love for God and Torah.

Though, Yabneh housed a mosaic of Jewish thought, which created a tension

between plebeian and patrician interpretation of law. Gamaliel, the patrician head of the

academy, represented this strife as his strict and conservative exegesis was purported to

speak for the people as a whole (115). The plebeian opinion soon became

undistinguishable amidst the dominant banter. Though after a sequence of challenges to

this established authority, Akiba proved his rabbinic superiority and Yabneh became a

place for the plebeian agenda to be addressed (127). This “reconstruction of the Law”

that Akiba was spearheading represents the new course of Judaism, which eventually led

to the foundation of current day Reformative Judaism (135). No longer an aristocracy,

Yabneh was now a nomocracy, with Akiba deciding the nomos (custom, law) that their

studies should follow. These chosen guidelines for study contributed the Torah’s future

relevance, as Akiba claimed to serve a higher cause than literal exegesis—that being the

cause of human happiness (174). He recognized the futility of the Written Law tradition.

The fluid nature of Oral Law would allow Judaism to be applicable in future times as

“human happiness” is a perpetual human goal (155). Akiba’s revolutionary course of

rabbinic scholarship produced the codified Mishna, which continues to be recalled today

(157). Though, this part of Akiba’s goal was the easier of the two, as it only involved

matters within his country.</p><p>

As the presence of Hellenism was becoming more and more pervasive in Judaea,

it manifested itself, in its purest form, as an impediment upon the study of Law (260). In

hopes of working effectively with power, Akiba boiled down his agenda to one, singular

item that would save Judaism from extinction. All he asked of the world was the

opportunity for a thriving culture of Rabbinic scholarship (257). The Jewish historian

Josephus notes this common fervor among rabbinic scholars in contrast to the harsh

opposition that was eventually presented by the Romans. Akiba knew that the Jewish

position was insignificant, so he attempted to negotiate with Roman power in the best

way he could. He did not want autonomy, or relief from the annual tribute-- only the

chance for his monotheistic religion to function through study. For as Judaism is a system

of knowledge “of God and His Law”, its survival depended on its maintenance of

scholarship (260). Though to the Romans, Akiba’s seemingly small request was the most

dangerous threat to the Empire’s goals at the time.</p><p>

Since Judaea existed as a miniscule province within the vast Roman Empire, the

environment of that relationship largely determined the success of Akiba’s efforts towards

the Torah’s salvation. To provide context for Hadrian’s reign beginning in 117, the period

from 95 to 117 illustrates the Jewish position going from moderate to worse. Hadrian’s two

predecessors, Nerva and Trajan, began the era of the Five Good Emperors, for Rome that is

(153). Under Nerva, the client relationship appeased both parties, as depicted by that

generation’s coinage bearing “Fisci Judaici Calumnia Sublata,” meaning that there were no

more malicious Jewish taxes (153). Also at the time, the policy of the Jews towards Rome

was producing mutually beneficial results. The plebeians of Jerusalem were opposed to

aggressive wars against weaker neighbors, and favored submission to the powerful

imperialist states (199). To the Romans, the Jews initially existed as a marginal population.

To the Jews, the Romans were allowing them to freely study and practice, and as that was

the essence of their lives, they were content. It is to be expected that this fostered a sense of

hope in Judaea, possibly even for the rebuilding of the Temple, having been destroyed only

a couple decades prior (217). It wasn’t until Trajan’s promise for a new Temple was

revoked that the tensions began to rise. A new ethos was created among Jewish

nationalists, who now felt encouraged that they could achieve a victory as memorable as

that of the Hasmoneans (228). Because the Jews now presented this rebellious insult to

Rome, Trajan’s policy of kindness turned to repression (234). Soon after, Trajan died,

leaving the throne, and a shaky client relationship, to Hadrian.<p><p>

In the 13 years before Hadrian’s first direct encounter with Judaea in 130, his reign

was that of a golden era of tranquility. A large part of this peace was due to Hadrian’s

promotion of a duel culture of worship. First existed the cult of emperor worship (42). In

referring to himself as Hadrian Augustus, a clear connection was established between the

revered founder of the Empire and the man who was in a sense refounding it (46). Part of

this peace and prosperity came from the fact that Hadrian’s religious and spiritual policies

were initially only directly forced upon the polytheists of his empire. Because of this, the

state cult did not present itself as a major offense to said subjects (40). Though, Hadrian

recognized that “all this dry machinery” of the emperor cult was not enough (42). The

second part of the worship culture is that of the cult of the goddesses Roma and Venus

(42). To his happiness, this cult grew popular largely due to its publicly attractive nature:

temples, statues and worship sites were erected throughout the empire, notably, the

Pantheon (42). The promoted Roman gods as well as the divine Hadrian were meant to

create “common denominators of citizenship” throughout the Empire (42). This goal was

achieved, either by genuine success of the polytheist inhabitants of the Empire, or by

feigned success in fear of powerful retribution if they denied worship. The exception to this

harmonious unity would present itself upon Hadrian’s trip to Judaea.<p><p>

As a complement to this network of worship, Hadrian propagated a culture of

mystery cults. In the east, they had taken hold. The cults provided the individual with the

emotional comfort that the state cult lacked (103). As evidenced in Apuleius’s narrative of

the Golden Ass, the worshipper developed a close personal relationship with the god, and

was offered explanations of the universe, redemption from evil, and eternal salvation of the

soul (103). Hadrian’s empire was being introduced to a new ethereal energy that was not to

be easily accepted by every inhabitant. Participation in such cults allowed the individual to

transcend the mundanity of daily life, as is what occurred during Hadrian’s visit to Athens

in 128 (106). Upon experiencing the Mysteries of Eleusis here, a spiritual fever was

instilled in the emperor, thus aiding him to conceive his next daring gestures to focus the

loyalties and imaginations of the Greeks (106). This personal change would soon reflect a

grand change in the Empire’s culture. It compelled Hadrian to leave the familiar terrain of

Rome and Athens in a most vigorous attempt to revive Greek civilization throughout the

provinces (107). The same Hellenism that was a threat to the Jewish existence was starting

to become a key element to Hadrian’s agenda. Though, that is not to say that the seductive

nature of Hellenism did not appeal to some of Judaea’s inhabitants. While Josephus notes

that many a Jew could be spotted strolling to the local γυμνάσιον (gymasion), majority of

them felt compelled to maintain a pious allegiance to the covenant.</p><p>

The provinces needed to be drawn together in peace. Ideally each province would

become a unique tile in the larger Roman mosaic. He understood the benefit of retaining

the Greco-Roman tradition that was common to them all, thus authenticity was preserved

and semi-autonomy granted. But, how does a Roman Emperor balance unity without

uniformity? The answer lay in the notion that there must be one common thread, and for

Hadrian, that was a universal polytheism. Every inhabitant, whether an Egyptian

worshipping Isis and Osiris, or a Greek venerating a different pantheon of gods, exercised

a polytheistic reverence, thus acting as a leveling agent across the Empire (116). Also, the

widespread paganism allowed for participation in the state cult, which was crucial for

Roman patriotism (117). Hadrian was not presenting an issue for his Empire’s

polytheists—only a minor nuisance at most. It was the monotheists of the empire who

stood directly in the way of Hadrian’s pursuits.</p><p>

It is now that the resulting irony of this conflict takes its roots: Hadrian’s policies,

while intending to create a stronger Rome, would have the unintended result of marking the

beginning of the rise of Christianity at the expense of polytheism. For the Jews, their

reaction to such policies marks the foundations of modern Judaism that is rooted in the

Diaspora. Judaea had always remained restless during the Empire, for the Romans could

never establish a satisfactory compromise with Jewish political hopes and religious

customs. Upon visiting Antioch, Hadrian witnessed this turbulent ferment of cultures and

an undercurrent hostile to Rome. Judaea was undermining Hadrian’s efforts through their

arrogant separatism, and it became readily apparent that their refusal to assimilate

represented the largest roadblock to the Empire’s successful panhellenic unity (111).

In Spartianus’ Historia Augusta he cites the origins of the first Jewish revolt as a

response to Hadrian’s ban on circumcision. Advocates of this theory refer to the Hellenic

“enlightened” attitude of the emperor, as circumcision seemed a grossly barbaric custom to

him. Though in an account by Cassius Dio, Hadrian’s intention to refound Jerusalem as a
Roman colony with pagan temples is attributed to the rebellion. It is only understandable

that Jews were driven to action because they feared a dissolution of the Mosaic Covenant

by the prevalence of these pagan customs in Judea.</p><p>

After this initial rebellion in 132-135, the Jews waged a disastrous was against the

Roman Empire. Upon massacring and enslaving their people, Hadrian banned Jewish

residence in Jerusalem, which was resettled and renamed Aelia Capitolina, adorned with a

temple to Jupiter. From this point onward Judaism turned ever more away from Greco-

Roman culture. Though, it is also from this point onward that modern Judaism has its roots

in the following Diaspora. They were scattered through out the world, without their

prominent base in the Holy Land, and yet managed to survive even if they did so as a

marginalized people. They were studying the same Mishna produced from this era, thanks

to Akiba.</p>

<p>To many of the inhabitants of the Empire, this final Jewish action presented itself as

a seemingly “unnecessary” and violent rebellion in the distant land of Judaea, and this

perception cast a negative light on the Jews. This is evident in Eusebeius’ Ecclesiastical

History, as he notes that the instigator of the rebellions had suffered Hadrian’s “just

punishment” (6.3). Becoming cognizant of this new social mood, the early Christians, who

were still linked with these people to some degree, would attempt to distance themselves

from the Jewish cause, thus ending Jewish and Christian competition. Here begins some of

the initial tears in the schism between the two peoples of the Book. Again, many an irony

exists in Hadrian’s policies, as they planted the early seeds of a rising Christianity, which

would eventually overcome the empire.</p><p> The final war between the Jews and the Romans stands as a collision of two

distinct civilizations, one monotheistic, the other polytheistic, embodied by two men,

Hadrian the philhellene and Akiba the father of rabbinic Judaism. These men’s goals

were so closely tied to their persons: Hadrian would stop at nothing to unite his empire,

especially for this tiny monotheistic threat in his polytheistic world. Akiba would never

stop studying and respecting Torah, eventually entering martyrdom. It is even said that

after being imprisoned by the Romans, upon being given a minimal drink of water to curb

his starvation, he doused his hands and feet with it, as Torah sanctions the cleansing of

hands before eating or drinking. Their pursuits encapsulated every essence of their

beings: Hadrian was Graeculus, and Rabbi was not just a title for Akiba, but an identity.

Neither individual was willing to budge, even a bit, for to budge was to not only to

compromise the integrity of their nation’s cause, but it was to lose a part of themselves.</p>
